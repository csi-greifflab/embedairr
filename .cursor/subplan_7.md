- [x] Create integration examples
- [x] Clean up unused imports and code
- [x] Finalize architecture documentation

## Final Architecture

### Component Overview
1. **EmbedderConfig**: Centralized configuration management and validation
2. **DataProcessor**: FASTA loading, tokenization, and batch generation
3. **EmbeddingProcessor**: Embedding extraction and processing logic
4. **StreamingIO**: I/O operations and file management
5. **OutputManager**: Output formatting and display
6. **BaseEmbedder**: Component orchestration and high-level interface

### Integration Benefits
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each component has a single responsibility
- **Testability**: Components can be tested independently
- **Maintainability**: Clear interfaces and well-documented code
- **Reusability**: Components can be used across different embedder types
- **Scalability**: Easy to extend with new features

## Success Criteria Met ✅
- [x] All components successfully integrated
- [x] BaseEmbedder significantly reduced in complexity
- [x] All existing tests pass
- [x] Clean, maintainable architecture
- [x] No performance degradation
- [x] Comprehensive documentation
